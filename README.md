This Python script creates a Telegram bot that uses the Google Text-to-Speech (TTS) API and DeepL translation API to convert text messages into speech and translate them into a desired language. This bot serves various useful functions such as automatic translation, status checking, and more.

With this setup, the bot is capable of performing text-to-speech conversion, translating text into a target language, and providing a number of other useful features.

You can Host the app for free, however it's not 100% uptime on https://www.pythonanywhere.com
